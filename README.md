#  Hazardous Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Detector  

##  Overview  

This project simulates a **Hazardous EMF Detector** to identify dangerous electromagnetic fields in the **0.5 â€“ 3 GHz** frequency range using **MATLAB**.  

The system is designed to:  
- Detect EM waves in hazardous ranges  
- Trigger **SMS alerts via Twilio** when EM exposure is detected  
- Demonstrate **antenna design** and **EM detection blocks** in MATLAB  

It serves as a **prototype for real-world EMF safety monitoring** and is ideal for **academic or research projects** focused on electromagnetic safety and signal detection.

##  Tools & Libraries  

- **MATLAB** (with Antenna Toolbox)  
- **Twilio API** for SMS notifications  
- **Simulated EM environment** for testing and validation

##  Features  

###  Antenna Design  
- Designed using MATLAB **Antenna Toolbox**.  
- Simulates a broadband antenna targeting **0.5 â€“ 3 GHz** frequency range.  

###  EM Detection  
- MATLAB functional blocks detect hazardous EM waves within the target frequency range.  
- Thresholds are adjustable for different safety levels.  

###  Alert System  
- When EMF levels exceed the threshold, an **SMS alert** is automatically sent using the **Twilio API**.  

###  Simulation-Based Implementation  
- The entire system is simulated within MATLAB for safe and efficient testing.  
- Suitable for demonstrating the concept without real hardware exposure.
